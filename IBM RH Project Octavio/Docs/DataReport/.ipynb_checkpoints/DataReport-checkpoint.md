## DataSet

* The dataSet has:

    * 1470 rows (each row is an employee)
    * 34 Classifier variables (8 are categorical)
    * 1 target variable (Attrition)
    * The data set is a bit unbalanced considering that around 84% of the employee confirmed a negative attrition wish. This information was considered when evaluating the model quality metric.
